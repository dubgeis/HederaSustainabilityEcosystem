# Hedera Sustainability Ecosystem
A short guide to sustainability focused projects on Hedera

## Introduction
*This article is not a comprehensive “sustainability for beginners” guide. It’s more of a very brief (as possible) **first step** towards a guide for ecosystem-developers who wants to particpate in sustainability markets on Hedera. Since this area is growing at a pretty crazy pace **the information below is likely to go out of date relatively quickly**. We'll try to keep it up to date via [pull-requests](https://github.com/dubgeis/SustainabilityEcosystem/pulls) and [issues](https://github.com/dubgeis/SustainabilityEcosystem/issues). And I **hope the platforms themselves will add relevant information, “Statement of Values”, and roadmaps to their own site speaking to auditability around high quality carbon offsets/REC's**.*

## Sustainbility Platforms & Marketplaces
These are the application that you would use to work with them to develop, ‘mint’ and sell your carbon credits following the [IWA Standards](https://hedera.com/blog/hedera-hashgraph-and-application-partners-collaborate-with-the-interwork-alliance-on-sustainability-working-group-key-initiatives). We encourage applications committed to sustainability and offsetting on Hedera to submit a pull request and sign up as a deamnd platform below. For those who'd like 

### Open Source Projects

- This project's initial contribution was done in close collaboration with Envision Blockchain, Dovu, and others. It is based on the IWA Sustainability business working group's [Voluntary Ecological Markets Taskforce](https://github.com/InterWorkAlliance/Sustainability/tree/main/vem) ongoing work.
- Relevant HIPS for the Guardian include: [HIP - 19](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-improvement-proposal/blob/master/HIP/hip-19.md), [HIP - 28](https://github.com/EnvisionBlockchain/hedera-improvement-proposal/blob/master/HIP/hip-28.md), & [HIP - 29]().

### Supply Platforms

  - [Earth Week 2021: Dovu is tokenizing carbon offsets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0snNSQI1qc)
  - [DOVU: DeFi Carbon Offsetting on Hedera Hashgraph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy0ATUwL6L8)
  - [Trust Enterprises](https://trust.enterprises/): The minting and marketplace backbone that connects DOVU to all Hedera services. A foundational layer to record any decentralized logic and prove intent. Rapidly augment your SaaS with provable trust, no blockchain experience required. At the fraction of the cost of ethereum or bitcoin. 
    - Check out the [documentation](https://docs.trust.enterprises/) for a serverless API for building consensus, with a Laravel client to make building with Hedera as simple as possible, even in [no-code or low-code environments](https://twitter.com/flyinggazelle/status/1443839460169429019). 
    - [Unibar (Hedera21 prototype)](https://github.com/trustenterprises/unibar-prototype) If you need a gasless interface, inbuilt private key management and basic ethereum auth. With minting, management, pooling, and API capability.
    - [Dynamic NFT Specification](https://github.com/trustenterprises/hedera-dnft-specification) This is a description of the work in progress for implementing Dynamic Non-Fungible Tokens (dNFT) on Hedera Hashgraph. The goal is to bring together new community consensus on token standards and new primitives within the ecosystem to ensure interoperability and reduce fragmentation between products.
  - Hedera Improvement Proposal Discussions
    - [Ecological Carbon Taxonomy](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-improvement-proposal/discussions/83) Introduce a recommended path of the implementation of minting and maintenance of ecological tokens based on IWA sustainability specifications from the voluntary ecological markets taskforce. This combines and is the first use-case of dNFT/dFT on Hedera to provide an ability for tokens to attach an unlimited amount of evidence.
    - [Hedera Ledger Service (HLS)](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-improvement-proposal/discussions/131) A novel proposal on a new native liquidity service on Hedera to offer deep liquidity at a network-level.

We focus on guiding organizations through 3 major milestones on their Blockchain journey: Use Case Analysis, Proof of Concept Development and Enterprise Scaled Deployments.
- Hedera Project References: 
  * [HIP - 19](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-improvement-proposal/blob/master/HIP/hip-19.md): In collaboration with RECDeFi, established a specification to provide a standard way to use Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) within Hedera state entity memo fields and thereby support the issuance of Verifiable Credentials about Hedera state entities. Just as the owner of a Hedera entity demonstrates that ownership and so claims associated authorizations via signatures with the private key(s) corresponding to the entity, a controller of a DID demonstrates that control via signatures with (likely) a different private key. Consequently, the DID controller can, when engaging in off-Hedera interactions, effectively demonstrate their association to the Hedera state entity without any on-Hedera transaction.
  * [JavaScript DID SDK](https://github.com/hashgraph/did-sdk-js): Developed a JavaScript version of the [Java DID SDK](https://github.com/hashgraph/did-sdk-java). This repository contains the JavaScript SDK for managing DID Documents & Verifiable Credentials registry using the Hedera Consensus Service.
  * MRV for Carbon Offsets: The process used to create an ecological claim that can be validated and verified to be turned into an offset product is called measurement, reporting and verification (MRV). Today, this process of collecting the supporting data for these carbon offsets is heavily manual and prone to errors. Carbon offsets have a double-spend and potentially a double credit problem - currently there’s no way for you to determine that the same tree hasn’t been sold repeatedly. One of the important goals for the Paris Agreement of 2015 is to ensure the avoidance of double spending for carbon offsets. DLT technologies due to its maintenance of a global shared ledger, together with the consensus mechanism, are a perfect technology to resolve the double spending problem. Envision Blockchain has partnered with the Hedera team to develop a solution that addresses these challenges and is compliant to the standards defined in the IWA's Voluntary Ecological Markets taskforce.
  * Reveille Digital: Reveille Digital, an industry leading DLT solutions provider focused on the oil and gas industry, wants to leverage innovative solutions such as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT), Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verified Credentials (VCs) to offer trackable and immutable Environmental, Social, and Corporate Governance (ESG) metrics. To accommodate Reveille's strategic vision Envision Blockchain established a long-term relationship that focuses on many areas of the Reveille Digital sustainability practice such as advisory, business analysis, solution designing, solution implementation, and solution support. This implementation is based on the standards defined in the IWA's Voluntary Ecological Markets taskforce.
